So not only you nerfed her, you nerfed her wardrobe.

Let's be honest y'all, lotus Irelia is pretty underwhelming. there is nothing to say about her. She is just irelia. That's it?

As an Irelia main that already has all her skins, I feel really underwhelmed, there is no motivation for me to get this skin, not even character loyalty. The palette is tacky and unfitting, and it has no theme. (And no, slapping a re-used word in the title doesn't give the model itself a theme). It's just so bad.

I know Riot is trying to make us spend on recolors, but this is ridiculous, and also a spit to the face of all Irelia users."

cr8i97e,t1_cr8asvq,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431571651.0,1,0,Me and a buddy have been playing a ton of Trist/Zil together. At first it was just for laughs (double bombs lel XD) but we found it to be extremely effective. We've began running double ignite with it and almost always get first blood and/or a few kills in the first few levels. The delayed damage stacks up so hard that people are never ready for it. The lack of Exhaust is slightly made up for by Zil's ult and the lack of Heal doesn't hurt that bad since Zil has two speed boosts and Trist has a huge leap and a disengage ult
cr871im,t1_cr84s2g,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431552070.0,1,0,It should actually make her E something you can use during late-game fights. It's crazy they kept all her enormous cast times through the re-work.

The jungler tanks now build more HP than resistances. Trundle heals from that, but the resistances are the biggest part. He also doesn't have an enemy jungler close to him all the time.

For top lane tanks, Mao has his ult, which is not counterable by trundles ult. So Mao will still reduce all the dmg by 20% and heal back up. Hec and Rumble top are both not really tanks. Sion is the only one and he got nerfed over and over to not be a possible permanent top lane pick.

People call it the tank meta, but we actually have less tanks top than before cinderhulk. Only in the jungle the amount increased and Naut came to the bot lane after his changes. AP Cho mid is not a tank."

 He excellled at making it easy for his team to take out the sole frontline of the enemy team. Now that there are multiple frontliners and even cases when you have 4 tanky characters in a team his utility to remove said frontline isnt really that effective anymore. Before you would run the enemy team down as soon as their sole means of protecting the backline vanished, now its just whatever we still have enough tankyness.

Do you care to address any of the concern about this feature lowering the skill cap for AD carries?"
cr884k6,t1_cr876pm,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431553863.0,243,0,"honestly, any change we make to usability will ""lower"" the ""skillcap"" of whatever the feature helps because you can become skilled at avoiding frustrating systems. That said, my personal philosophy is that the kinds of skills we should focus on letting players master are the ones that feel more satisfying once you've mastered them than they do frustrating when you're trying to learn them. 
I play a lot of Osu, so precise clicking in rhythmic patterns is a type of game I love playing. League isn't really built for that in the same way though, and I think that mastering the timing and spacing for kiting is more important than mastering clicking on the exact unit radius of a character each time. Basic attacks and targeted spells in our game were built to be reliable so that we could focus on the other strategic elements of decision making (when do I use this ability, how close should I be, etc). 
Like I said though, this is my personal design philosphy and isn't reflective of our design team as a whole. Lots of us have differing opinions on what types of systems we want players to focus on mastering. We built this change with the ability to disable it however, so I'll be watching response really closely. We are not afraid to turn it off if it makes the game worse."
cr886te,t1_cr884k6,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431553967.0,26,0,Thanks for expanding on this.
cr8etcp,t1_cr884k6,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431565567.0,5,0,"Well to me, League doesn't even have a very high skillcap in the mechanical sense. But with this change there are a lot of scenarios that it makes a ton easier if you haven't developed good mouse accuracy. Like trading in lane is a huge one as an ADC and range support, there are usually a lot of minions infront of you, so you can get punished a decent amount when you misclick. Another one is in big teamfight when you've got melee's on you and want to hit a target behind them. Maybe a squishy is almost dead and you can take them out with an auto real quick while kiteing the enemy? Well if you misclick you hit the melees in front of you and they get away, but with this change you're going to get it regardless. Also if you're fighting around an objective like Baron or Dragon and you're hiding behind your team if you misclick you attack that objective. To me attack move as it is makes the game a lot easier, so making an easier version of this is just dumb. Maybe the biggest thing is to scare riot away from making little Quality of Life changes for mechanical aspects of the game, because this one here could cause more and more to happen.

edit: also, in the lategame on ranged champs you spam attack speed, DOES require a lot of ""clicking on the exact unit radius of a character each time. "" This change takes away a lot of mechanical skill in high pressure situations imo."

How come there isn't a way to bind left mouse button to evtPlayerAttackMoveClick via the options menu in game and it has to be done via the input.ini file? Why is left mouse button disabled by default in terms of allowing players to bind it to something? (hopefully this isn't a dumb noob question). 

It is just something that I have been wondering about for a while now. I prefer to have my right mouse button mapped to PlayerMoveClick as it is by default but have player attack move click on the left one but until I figured out I could set it via the .ini file I could never bind it in game. "
cr8pld6,t1_cr884k6,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431592077.0,1,0,"I'm on the same boat as you when it comes to games requiring precise clicking.  I used to play thousands of tournaments in Starcraft's Sniper games and I'm the kind of guy who prefers sniping from a roof, building, or hill in FPS games.  The problem I have with this is that it reduces the skill needed for aiming, rewarding those who can't control their mouse properly.  This is like giving an FPS game an auto-lock feature.  I sincerely hope this is never implemented/allowed in the professional scene, and I'm absolutely disappointed that this will be an option in ranked games.  It's a crutch and will always be a crutch, no matter how much emphasis is being put on positioning.  It's part of the game.  The same argument could be made for so many aspects of League.  This is overboard but this is how it feels when I hear anything about this attack move function: ""We've given the option to toggle jungle camp resets to either 5 pulls or infinity because we feel like junglers need to focus more on map objectives and looking at lanes."""

cr8b1k7,t1_cr884k6,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431558926.0,-1,1,"My issue with this, as well as the context in the patch notes, is that it seems like Riot is saying that the feature to disable Attack Move Cursor should satisfy all of the players for or against this change. I don't understand this at all. The way I see it, disabling Attack Move Cursor puts you at a strict, straight across the board disadvantage to a player that's using Attack Move Cursor. It's like aim assist in the console Call of Duty games, and all of the professional players use aim assist. There's simply no reason not to; it makes the game easier.

Obviously we can argue for days over game philosophy and whether this feature will be good for the game, but I really do not think the toggling ability alleviates both sides of the argument in the slightest. Very few, if any, people have issues with the current attack move system. People oppose ACM because it will lower the skill floor for the AD role, not because it introduces change."

Targeted abilities and AAs in League are supposed to be easy and reliable to hit. There isn't supposed to be that element of skill, they are promoting the value of decision making, spacing, and timing over how accurate you are with a mouse. It isn't about lowering the skill ceiling, or making the playing field even between people who are and aren't using it. They don't like misclicks being a significant factor for parts of the game (LoL specifically) that are meant to be about something else."

Just like they don't want arbitrary typing tests in the game, they don't want something like mouse accuracy on AAs to be a determining factor either.

You have completely ignored their point. It is not ""making the game easier"", it is changing the balance of which skills are rewarded. Whereas a player with inferior judgement and good ""mouse accuracy"" could beat a player with good judgement and poor ""mouse accuracy"" simply do to a misclicked AA, now the matchup goes the other way. And Riot wants to reward judgement over mouse accuracy.

If you can't see how that isn't lowering the skill and has literally nothing to do with elo or ""baddies"" then that is just you being dense."

That IS the compromise Riot is trying to make. Riot is saying, ""Well, if you don't like the change, AT LEAST you can disable it so everybody wins."" Riot even puts the caption in the patch notes for this as the ""So Much Change"" Aversion. My point was that the people who oppose the change oppose it not because ""bummer, now I have to change the settings I've been playing with for 2 years, they should just leave it"" but because the attack move change makes the ADC role fundamentally easier. Not having the attack move cursor puts you at a strict disadvantage to the other player. The vast majority of criticism I've seen for this change deals with the fact that it lowers the skill floor. All I'm saying is that if Riot is going to complain about not receiving feedback, they should at least correctly address the feedback they've been given."

Riot wants to streamline an aspect of the game. Which requires them to introduce a new mechanic.

In order to avoid backlash, they allow you to disable the new mechanic.

Yes, you are at a ""disadvantage"" if you don't use it. Just like you are at a ""disadvantage"" if you don't use the current attack-move/click.  Riot doesn't care, and they explained why.

&gt;The vast majority of criticism I've seen for this change deals with the fact that it lowers the skill floor

IRRELEVANT! That has NOTHING to do with why they allow you to disable it, nor is it a relevant argument for the point they are trying to make with this addition.

&gt;if Riot is going to complain about not receiving feedback, they should at least correctly address the feedback they've been given.

Not just did they not do anything of the sort, he LITERALLY responded EXACTLY to the skillfloor question you raised in the comment you were actually responding to originally. They are emphasizing a different kind of skill. You want to cripple your ability by using to old mechanic, that is ok too, Riot doesn't care.

It seems giving up that functionality to just ""well if you miss by a little bit things will be ok!"" Doesn't seem like an upgrade at all...

You are not giving up anything, you should read again how it works. Kiting backwards will work exactly the same way as before especially if you are being chased by someone who is the only or closest target inside your attack range."

cr8fo6l,t1_cr8eyr7,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431567103.0,1,0,"That's how it worked before anyway, when you attack move unless you specifically point and click on a target it will attack the closest one in range. What the new feature adds is a very small circle around your mouse pointer to give some leneance when you miss your target by a few pixels (so it will attack that target instead of the target closest to you, which is what happens now before the patch).

I'm pretty sure you either don't actually understand how kiting works or we are not on the same page. When you are kiting with attack move you are alternating between attack move clicks (to attack) and right-clicks (to keep moving in between auto-attacks), this is clear right? By simply attack moving the whole time it's technically and practically impossible to kite (both with the old and the new attack move command)

EDIT

Reading your other replies I think I understand what you are saying now. It won't be a problem since the attack move mouse circle will be really small in practice. You also have the option to disable the new behaviour so that pretty much ends any argument."
cr8ibgm,t1_cr8fo6l,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431571758.0,1,0,"Yeah I'm not arguing, I'm actually just genuinely trying to learn. If I'm kiting backwards, I will shift+click behind me (to auto), and then right click to move. This means the mouse doesn't bounce all over the place because I'm really clicking in a straight line back, alternating clicks.

With the new system, assuming there's an enemy or a creep or w/e behind me, I will need to shift+click near the enemy (in front of me), move my mouse behind and right click (to move backwards), move mouse near enemy and shift+click etc. This requires a LOT of mouse movement or very precise mousing.

If I'm chasing someone, they're both nearly identical. New attack move also is technically better than just right clicking on the champ, because you'll have animation cancelling and requires LESS precision because you dont need to technically click on the champ.

Either way, I don't see how this is ""super gamebreaking"" like a lot of the comments are saying. I'm not disagreeing or anything, I'm just confused."

Not really, as i said the circle for the new attack move is really small. The only ""precision"" you'll need is to not click very close to the target behind you which should be rather easy. You'll understand better once you do this in practise.

&gt;If I'm chasing someone, they're both nearly identical. New attack move also is technically better than just right clicking on the champ, because you'll have animation cancelling and requires LESS precision because you dont need to technically click on the champ.

 That's correct except for the animation cancelling part. Using attack move does not do animation cancelling for you, you actually have to move your champion as soon as your auto attack leaves your champion to actually cancel (part) of the animation whether you attack move or not.

&gt;Either way, I don't see how this is ""super gamebreaking"" like a lot of the comments are saying. I'm not disagreeing or anything, I'm just confused.

It's not. Most are exaggerating, I personally see this as a QoL change rather than making the game easier but each to his own

cr88io4,t1_cr88fge,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431554516.0,1,0,"Yup, it should all be in there.

Smart casting I believe is now enabled by clicking the small tab under the bindings for QWER. What this does is immediately cast your ability upon the keystroke, instead of showing the range indicator."

In the case of point and click abilities, it will immediately cast on the target you are hovering over. In the case of skillshots, it will immediately fire the skill in the direction of your cursor, or the area around it - depending on it being an AoE or a line shot."

Also how that account for it if im chasing and i want to be a little more in range than max range before casting because is it casts at max range my tsrget would be out of range before it reaches them?"
cr8ailx,t1_cr89wnr,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431557981.0,0,0,"No, you don't have to keep your cursor where you want to cast it until you reach the range.

The command is issued when you click the ability keybind, so you will simply move to cast it at max range to wherever your cursor was when you issued the command.

In the case of casting while chasing, if you simply cast it a small distance away from you, the skillshot will continue to travel to max range in the direction of the cast and will hit your target if it is within range.

It's important to note the difference with abilities that are technically AOE, like Shyvana's R. If you cast Shyvana's R a short distance away from you, it will simply jump to that point and you won't get a max range jump.

If she is support she is a pain in the rear, causing you to more or less focus the one that is in a good position to not be focused because of Black Shield.  

Her W does an absurd amount of damage if you're CCed in it, and her CC can keep you locked up in it for nearly the full duration.  This is one of the few spells in the game that you can actually kill caster minions without needing any real AP.  

Everyone knows the joys of her ult.  

Her Q?  The one time per game I don't manage to dodge it... I go take a dump, read the news paper, wipe real good, get up, lather my face with my favorite shaving gel and proceed to remove the day's stubble.

The numbers are really the reason why champions are played or don't see play. If you go on /r/leagueoflegendsmeta and ask why a champion doesn't see play everyone will provide you with a lists of disadvantages that particular champion has. But you can set up such a list for every champion. In the end it always comes down to the numbers, and if they outweigh potential disadvantages the kit of the champion may have. Champions generally see play if they get buffed, others get nerfed, or the meta shifts due to buffs and nerfs and makes one of their mechanics favorable. Numbers are the reason behind all of that."

Xin lacks mobility in comparison to other champs.  When he was really popular he was beyond broken to the point that his weakness in mobility was completely covered up by overtuned damage numbers.

Now, that weakness in mobility is actually pretty glaring because his numbers aren't as ridiculous and people take that lack of mobility into picking champions because honestly numbers aren't everything.

And I don't even know why you're talking about Cass. Xin Zhao is a fighter champion that needs to be in melee range to be effective, that means the enemy can easily focus him down because his lack of mobility and tankiness. Cass is a short range mage whose job is to kite and dishes out damage.

If you build him full damage or even bruiser you'll have 1 or 2 amazing carry games followed by a dozen or so games where you feed super hard.  His E range is just too short to get to the back line.  Not to mention everyone has CC these days.  Your best bet is to build him full tank and use him as a mini Randuin's bot with his W to peel for your carries.

Xin is like all bruiser junglers - if you don't build some early tank stats, you're gonna get shit on in team fights.  So if you build damage, you'd better either split push, or have some beefy front liners to help your dive.

I personally like Cinderhulk -&gt; Phage -&gt; Ninja Tabi -&gt; Hexdrinker for a build path.  Gives him some decent damage, and good defenses against physical &amp; magic damage.  After that, either complete the phage item or just keep getting tankier."

cr8m4se,t1_cr85k8y,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431579780.0,1,0,I kinda view it as a solo Q nerf and a competitive tuning. The counter jungling potential is still real. The debuff time reduction will just force people to trade faster/smarter
cr8osgx,t1_cr85k8y,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431588546.0,1,0,"From the pure item alone, sunfire is way better. 

Only +350g for +45 Armor and +75 HP and a 66.7% stronger passive. If you get another 1k HP for cinderhulk, it will change to -175 HP, but that still keeps sunfire better.

For the summoner spells. The smite start in the jungle is not really surperior for a 1v1 lane. Most of its power comes from the 2v1 lane swaps in the competitive scene. Flash has the higher CD, but it keeps you safe or allows you to grab kills. The 20% dmg reduction on challenging smite is good, but with only 4 sec, you have a very limited time window now to turn the tides. The true dmg bonus will not be more than 126 + 14*lvl (7 seconds) compared to the old 162 + 18*lvl (30% reduction).

Overall, smite top laners were already pretty bad in soloQ. The statistics said that nearly only Shyvana had a slight increasae in her top lane win rate with smite, but an unimportant one. Now that it is nerfed, all top lane smite champs should actually be better off without it. Only certain people who really understand how to use it may be able to come out ahead with smite. Even pros didn't recommend the smite top lane in soloQ too much because its loss of power in standard lanes. Smite makes you flexible, being able to lane 1v2 or 1v1 or even 2v2. You can farm the jungle if needed or fight enemies or prevent your death when they dive you, but that happens less frequently in soloQ, especially the lower your ranking is."
cr8w3o2,t1_cr8osgx,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431613245.0,1,0,"Sunfire is very gold efficient in comparison yes. The main thing I have been arguing this thread though is matchup and it is more situational.
Sunfire so far looks like a better item for early skirmishes as its build bath gives stats for use in lane while cinderhulk I spend 850 fold making one of my summoners something other than a free gromp buff.

However the beauty of the smite top lane is not playing a normal top lane like you would with sunfire. The playstyle should change with the item just how I have been playing. Whenever I go smite top my playstyle sees some changes that make me a mid-late game threat rather than an early game one. If I win early game it just makes me that much better.

Cinderhulk gives me an extra 30 g whenever I clear a camp. Which I do a lot of as a top laner specially going to the enemy jungle and contesting enemy buffs. I give up pressure top to do this yea but I usually can push lane before I go do this as champions such as shyvana, sion, mundo etc. Also can look for roams after pushing. having smite also allows me to contest buffs in the face of the enemy jungler. EXP and gold are all a win. (gromp buff is also brainless pickup on health stackers)

EXP is a big part of the playstyle. I am farming a normal top lane as well as jungle creeps whenever I get the chance so my level in most of my games is usually the highest in the game even if I go even top lane.

My main reason for liking this item is its the blackcleaver. 400 health and 20% cdr never felt so good oh wait. 500 health with cinder hulk sign me up.

Vs flash yea I can miss out on a kill or die top but it is a 5 minute cooldown vs a 1 minute cooldown that I can use to jungle if Im not going to fight anytime soon or use to win a trade.

As I say my argument is more of a conditional. It is a different playstyle and I will probably not run smite everygame anymore like I have been. But the option is still there and still strong enough to warrant purchase."

Once I get up to mid gold ELO I will start using TP Smite.

You can only ensure you yourself are mechanically good. TP is better when you know your team can help you make it useful like a tp bot. You don't want the TP going in to the enemy teams favor.

cr96i92,t1_cr967ze,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431630516.0,1,0,"Flash is a 5 minute cooldown spell that is the most versatile in the game. Some people argue that if you learn how to play a champion without flash you will be just so much better once you start to take it. 

But that is not the reason I do not take it. Shyvana has her ult and W for catching potential as well as I always build botrk on her so most of my targets like ADC's do not have enough escape even with flash to get away from me unless its over 2 walls. The ignite sticks on someone even if they flash so it can kill after flash and so can the burn from red smite. Not taking flash only works on certain champions and I feel my performance with 2 offensive spells has been better than with flash.

This doesn't mean you should never take it as if the enemy team is super mobile like kassadin, leblanc, then I will be in favor of just running flash + (ign smite or TP)

Shyvana is a special case. Other champs might want flash in more situations. such as udyr as he has 0 ways to get over a wall."

1. Tank junglers will once again be getting outclassed by carry junglers as they will lose the early game and won't have the same dominance. 
2. (which I think is more likely) We will lose a lot of the champion diversity that arose with the introduction of cinderhulk. The tank junglers will clear camps extremely fast and are able to impact the early-game much more. This will lead to an decrease in play of immobile/tanky champions like Cho and Urgot.

Yeah, of course. The thing is that when the minions meet, both ADCs are pushing the minions for a level advantage, therefore Ashe will get a dagger worth of combat stat over her opponent by default at level 1-2. That's huge for trading.

Here's why I think she will be insanely strong. Aside from the fact that she now has a free single target permaslow built into her kit, Riot also gave her 3 forms of steroids.

 - The 10% flat AD onto her autos

 - The attack speed steroid of her Q

 - The autoattack damage modifier of her Q

The scary part is that the damage modifier of her Q actually scales multiplicatively with her passive. 

With an IE and PD, Ashe deals 100% + 10% + 82.5% = 192.5% AD per auto using her passive.

With 5 stacks of Q, Ashe's Q active deals 192.5% x 135% =  260% AD per auto for 4 seconds. (they do stack this way, I've tested it on the PBE)

That level of DPS, with the same build, is comparable to Draven catching every single axe for 4 seconds straight with maxed Spinning Axe. Then you gotta remember that she slows you for 50% for those 4 seconds.

I'll give it until tomorrow afternoon before people start to make Reddit posts about how OP she is. "

cr902hg,t1_cr8bezz,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431620188.0,1,0,"Not just that. Her W got butchered. W was by far the best thing about Ashe. Being able to poke through minions like 90% of adcs can do was important for her to stay in lane. Now she will have to try to get the angles around the minion wave which makes her prone to morg Q hooks and a shitload more. Not just that, her ult slow now scales with slow %. This is terrible. I think this is a reverting back to s2 ult passive when they realised that ult should have abit more cc since you know **Ashe is a UTILITY champ**.  
Since Q was getting maxed on Ashe second we are losing some slow %. At level 2 we used to have 15% slow on Q. Now we will reach that value at lvl 7. Honestly, it isn't even worth the trouble to turn around and slow people when you are running away. The animation of turning to attack will just render your slow useless. Sure we aren't putting points into it, but it's kinda :( So really everything that we have come to love about ashe has been taken away besides the lack of mobility that i'm sure new players will enjoy teaching them to position. Her Q looks interesting and could prove to be quite strong. But this is still the same style of Ashe and those who were bad at Ashe will continue to be bad with Ashe. Ashe is about using your brain to position and landing your ult. If you can't do either, no rework will save you. "

The ult change was necessary. It's one of a few ""skillshots"" in the game that requires very little skill because it is almost undodgeable. You need a dash, flash, super speed, or invulernability to outplay Windslash. Good luck dodging an E -&gt; Windslash.

40% increase on Hec's Q hurts a lot, maybe he will go back to being a Tier 3 jungler with the Q damage increased to 100% versus monsters...yayy.

Ranger's is in a good spot, Chilling smite could use a very slight power increase (it was fine until they nerfed the range of Smite - now I feel like its a little underpowered). With the nerf (which seems about right) Skirmisher's should be on the level of Ranger's or Chilling. Now to just balance Poacher's..."

Also disagree with his being a tier 3 jungler, but that's just my personal preference - I think he's still extremely strong from there."

The 60% rank 1 Q mana cost increase will hurt lane hec a lot. But jungle hec will be fine due to the dmg buff. Especially with blue he will be able to clear the jungle pretty fast early.

The rank 5 25% mana cost increase isn't that hard on Hec. Jungle hec will still farm more cost effective and faster than before. Top lane Hec can take that much.

The overall problem is that the rank 1-3 Q mana costs are so high for top lane hec, that he will probably fall out of the meta and may be even unplayable. But the changes overall make his jungle speed really fast and efficient. With the nerf to cinderhulk, hec could be a T2 jungler, if not higher."

The only use you can get out of it is to invade every time you have smite up, which is a dangerous move at best. When you buy poachers, you are essentially telling the enemy team you intend to invade constantly, ruining your chances of invading effectively. 

For poachers to become effective, it would need to be hidden in your inventory, which is contrary to Riot's goal of providing clarity. "

If you accidentally attack move on the ground INSTEAD of an enemy, it'll attack the closest enemy to your CURSOR, instead of your CHAMPION.


Currently, attack moving on the ground will ALWAYS attack the closest target to your CHAMPION.

If you attack move directly on an enemy already, nothing changes at all. Nothing changes with how your champion moves, either... this is really just about target selection. Your champion will always move to begin an attack on a target, if it needs to get in range. I hope this help clarify things."

But if she's alone in a lane, or has pressure and the other guy is playing scared, the reduced cooldown means not just better waveclear but also better sustain, whichis super broken if they get the numbers wrong so i can see why they've been so cautious with the buff.

I mean with a lower energy cost akali coukd be like a snowballing nasus. Take defensive runes/masteries/first item and just shrug off harass with your sustain while hyper scaling and the other guy wastes mana trying to dent you.

Riot are wary of free sustain cos it's almost impossible to balance or for all skill levels. Lower elo players simply DO a lot less in lane, so free sustain is super broken. Akali is most known for ruining low elo games, and riot would rather she's balanced for low elo and weak at higher levels than balanced for higher elos hut a mega pub stomper"

If only her E is the 2nd lowest energy ability in the game. OH WAIT A SECOND! IT IS! The only ability to have a lower energy cost is Zed's Living Shadow with 20 at max rank. 

Akali's E has only 40 cost at max rank. The next lowest is max rank Kennen Q's 45 and Electrical Surge's 45.

cr8fsxv,t1_cr8eb47,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431567341.0,3,0,"&gt;Your comparing different champions energy pools which is completely irrelevant.

How is that irrelevant? Every single energy champ has the SAME EXACT 200 ENERGY. How can Akali's energy cost be high when its the 2nd lowest in the game? What makes it high then if you dont compare to other energy abilities? Even if you just compare to her own kit, it is still the lowest energy cost ability. Q has 60 and W has 80 to 60 while E has 60 to 40.

&gt;Using up a good deal of your energy to clear waves isn't smart. If you get ganked your going to need it to fight or run away.

Meanwhile, Zed uses 165 to 125 energy to waveclear which also includes his escape and all his damage. 

Kennen uses 170 out of 200 energy to use QWE to wave clear at max rank, which also includes his escape and all his damage. 

Lee uses at least 50 energy to wave clear if he only use Tempest. 

Then you look at Akali, oh look, she only uses 60 to 40 energy and it doesn't include her using her escape or main damage source. 

Do you even know what you are talking about or are you just blinding typing shit without looking at the kits and energy costs? "

If you are split pushing you have at least 2, probably 3 wards near your lane to cover your ass. You aren't just going to get instaganked unless you're against TF/Nocturne/Pantheon. It also helps clear the wave just before going back.

* Akali kills enemy laner
* Akali pushes the wave
* Next wave is nearby
* Akali runs up to it and clears it quickly with E spam
* Akali goes back

Now ? Any of those immobiles carries on the back line get ever touched by a snowball, all your team is getting fucked up because their tank will just go past the frontline to directly fuck with the carries. 

Dodging 3-5 snowballs every 20 seconds is nearly impossible... especially when you are at risk even 2 screens away. And all your team mates have to dodge them as well, not just you.


Basically, snowball shifted the power from immobile champions that benifited having having a permanent front line to bruisers that had difficulties getting close. IMO, it destoyed more champions than it helped others. Playing pick off and not getting kited to death is an art. Pressing a 2 screen long summoner every 20 seconds until it hits something is not."

Also about playing safe early and waiting for items to become available. Now poke is terrible after 5 minutes and the team with the most tanks wins every engagement. :(

ARAM also used to be an effective team fight exercise. Now the idea of zoning and positioning are useless when Amumu can come in from over a screen away to ult your backline whenever he wants. :(

Snowball is overpowered, plain and simple. It allows instant engage. That is HUGE in ARAM. I'm very glad they nerfed the poke damage (because now tanks out-poking the enemy Nidalee and Varus with no downside was just dumb).  But with its insane utility, why does it even *do* damage? 

Having damage encourages people to spam it whenever it's up even with no intention to go in at all. This might not be so bad, but with its cooldown being so low, there's no 'meaningful choice' here. If the cooldown were higher it would encourage tanks to only use it when they actually want to go in, instead of literally off cooldown every time.

Weaknesses of Zed's laning phase? Alright, here you go:

- High energy cost, even with refund mechanic its pretty hard to manage if you spam, you will go out of energy insanely fast without Blue Buff
- His Ult gets countered by almost everything unless you manage to bait/outplay your opponent, I think reward for doing so is okay, no?
- His escape is also his damage, see? A pretty good trade-off
- He is melee and mainly played in a lane dominated by Ranged champs,  again a good weakness and way to handle him
- .... I could continue to tell you more and more ways to counter him, just ask if you want me to

If he throws out a shadow and uses his Q and E, he'll inevitably be low on Energy, especially if he misses with any of them.

His weaknesses are the fact that he's melee and will inevitably step up to farm, and the fact that his main mobility and damage utility (his Living Shadow) is on a long cooldown.  If his Shadow is down, your kill potential and trade potential goes way up.  He doesn't have great sustained damage, either, and is mostly reliant on the burst that his ult and Shadows give him.  If you're playing an AP champion, rush an Hourglass and completely nullify his ult and he can't do much about it.

Yeah, he has good poke and waveclear, but he often can't do both in the early game without being very starved for energy. He'll either concentrate on CSing with his Shuriken or melee (in which case you should poke him when he walks up), or he'll use his Shadow (Q + E) combos to clear the wave and keep you pushed, in which case his poke isn't anything to fear.  Watch his Energy bar closely and try to force trades while he's low, because he's a very combo-based champion and can't get much done with no Energy.  Constantly move around in lane and predict Shuriken and dodge them, since that's most of his poke, and don't walk near his Shadow so you can avoid his E (Shadow Slash).  He's a powerful laner, but he's by no means overpowered or uncounterable."

Yes, that's the downside. The upside is that they can spam their spells in a fight for a prolonged period of time. Play someone with energy, try to spam your spells, and see how many rotations you can get out of it. It's not more than 1 rotation and 1 additional spell.

With mana costs his early laning would change a LOT. He wouldn't have great waveclear, and he wouldn't have the easiest waveclear under turret imaginable, meaning he would be pushable, having much less roam pressure and much less follow up for ganks. I mean if they gave him mana they'd compensate in other ways - probably shorter cooldowns and high-ish mana costs, or low mana costs and longer cooldowns) but if you just added mana to his current numbers, OF COURSE it would be a nerf.

Why not? He can't do all of that simultaneously. Unless you suggest you want to give him mana (which would actually be a buff to him), I don't see why an assassin shouldn't be able to do that. Mages are better at poking/sieging/teamfighting, have more AOE or shields and are not melee. Not to mention that all the examples you mentioned have hard cc, while Zed doesn't. His only cc is when he uses W-E, which takes away his escape."
cr8877l,t1_cr87jpi,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431553985.0,12,0,"The problem is that Zed is still capable at poking, and still has a decent amount of aoe damage, plus % max hp that he can proc on everyone (although that takes time). Being AD based means he's also not completely reliant on his abilities, made even stronger because he gets free ad (which is why he can focus straight armor pen, because he'll have high AD anyway. 300 bonus AD is not uncommon, and that multiplied by another 25% is effectively another major AD item).

Syndra, for example, has less range than Zed. And while she does have CC, that's in place of her escape/mobility spell meaning less able to roam, more vulnerable to ganks, and more susceptible to being ""outplayed.""

And inferior to mana when it comes to teamfighting and everything else. Zed has energy to keep him from being an AOE damage spamming bruiser and force him into an assassin play pattern.  With the energy system, Zed is forced to deal burst skill damage, but with mana sure his early game would be weaker, but Manamune would mean constant skill spam mid-late game. Imagine a late game Zed who could actually benefit from Manamune. Then tell me again that you would prefer mana on Zed and that Energy has only upsides for him.

Using energy will **always** be inferior in fights. Play Ahri and see how long you can spam your spells in a fight. Then go play Zed, Kennen, or anyone else with energy and see how long you can spam your spells. You won't get much more than 1 rotation out of it.

You can increase your mana and mana regen but you can't do that for energy outside of blue buff, energy limits how many spells an energy user can use in a short period of time while mana limits how many spells a mana user can cast over a very long period of time.

&gt;Almost everything... in lane? Most mages if not all have to rush an Hourglass as their first item just to SURVIVE his ult combo.

CC, dashes, several other spells (like Fizz' pole) or some armor (Seeker's is enough) are more than enough to survive laning phase. His ult at level 1 is pretty weak and doesn't deal much damage, he has a lot of trouble even if you only have Seeker's.

&gt;He has an escape.

So... Just like any other assassin?

&gt;He has better ranged harass than many mages and can reliably last hit safely with Q alone for most of the lane.

Better harass than many mages? He has to use W if he wants to even get close to their range, which takes away his escape. And last hitting with Q will make you miss many minions and open you up for easy harass.

It seems like people just don't know how to abuse his weaknesses properly. If he was as OP as you guys think, you would see him much more often in competitive play or high elo play. Yet, he's mostly played in low elo, where people don't even know how to itemize properly."

They could also reduce the AOE from Distortion, to make it easier to avoid the dmg if you predict it.

I don't really understand why they ignore LB and Rek'Sai in this patch. It is not like Cinderhulk changes will make Rek'Sai that much weaker, especially not compared to other junglers.

cr8pc7a,t1_cr8amar,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431590889.0,0,1,"Really?

R is free. Q costs 60 but gives 40 back, so it only costs 20 and has a 4 sec CD. that means you regenerate 40 energy in that time, meaning as long as you only use R and Q, you gain 20 energy every 4 seconds.

Now to W. It costs 80, but the long CD means you only give the energy away as long as it is there (8 seconds). You only limit your max energy from 200 to 120 practically. 

So lets asume you play energy inefficent and you start with your W and keep W up all the time due to CDR and everything (normally impossible). You will only have that 120 energy left. Next up is the Q down to 60 and back up to 100 after the R + AA. Now you got 4 seconds where your energy goes back up to 140. Next combo of Q -&gt; R -&gt; AA will bring you to 120 and after 4 seconds to 160. Now you need the 60 energy for one Q, but you have 100 left to make 2 Es, leaving you with 20 energy + 40 from Q. That is enough for a 3rd E and a 3rd Q -&gt; R -&gt; AA combo when Q is ready again.

So in a full 3 time Q + AA combo without CDR, you have the energy to keep W up forever and you still got enough energy to cast 3 Es. But now you have more choices of when to use it and how often at that time instead of needing to time it well.

If Akali has CDR, the amount or Es she can cast will go down slightly. But because Akali doesn't get much more than 25% normally you will still be able to cast 2 Es in there.

Now add the blue buff on top of that. 50 energy reg goes up to 80 every 5 sec. 16 energy reg per sec. Now you can cast your E pretty often in a fight or a trade if you do it right.


That Akali doesn't use the E often and that she has no situations where she needs to manage her energy with E is a lie that was made up by bad Akali players. Sure, the lower CD will not make her that much stronger. The CD was already pretty low enough to cast E when it was needed. Now you only got a bit more control to maybe keep the energy early and burst it all out at the end if needed or to abuse the blue buff. 

But energy management on Akali means actually managing your E and nothing else."

Morgana on the other hand provides ZERO interaction to her lane. Literally drop W in the entire wave and back off. At lvl 5 she starts killing caster creeps with a single W, that's even more passive boredom fest. If anyone tries to interfere with this playstyle and engage on her she pops shield and backs off again. If someone persists she then uses binding and buys even more time to... back off again. Repeat this process over 10m-15m (depending on how long the laning phase persists). It's almost AP Yi levels of unfun to solo lane against a Morgana."

You can engage and trade against a Xerath or Ziggs lane.

You can't engage or trade against a Morgana lane. Her kit and playstyle don't allow you to.

That's why Morgana got the axe while the other two didn't get touched.

Hope that was clear enough."

Morgana's actually pretty easy to trade with since she's so binary. Either her snare hits or it doesn't. If her snare hits, she can trade. If it doesn't, she's absolutely worthless. The point isn't about TRADING. The whole argument has been about their playstyle in regards to how they can shove a lane.

Zed can be aggro as fuck, spamming W in lane and moving up for autoattacks, but he can also sit back and farm with Q and use W/E exclusively for farming and safety. A passive Zed is virtually impossible to deny CS.

The same is true of a ton of mages, they can choose to sit back and just CS, the reason they usually don't is because people like solo kills and snowballing even if a farmfest would be an entirely viable strategy for them.

The reason people hate on Morg is because her default playstyle is passive, she can only go aggro either when she lands a Q or they grossly mispositioned and let you initiate with R.

Adding this nerf will change how zed approaches people like ahri, xerath, and syndra, who have skillshot stuns. Zeds ult is already predictable enough with the short travel time and large x on your champ. This allows people who know to save their cc for zeds ult to just aim it behind them and walk away. They have a decent amount of time to prepare, and now that he cant instantly switch back, its childs play to hit. It is a massive nerf to his current play. This changes the decisions a zed player needs to make when ulting somebody, which shouldnt happen in what is supposed to be not a big deal.

&gt;Zed now has more counterplay.

Great. The assassin with the most counterplay has now even more counterplay.

&gt;What is the point of an ability that sends you to a target if you don't want to be there for at least 1 second. 

Uhm... Lol? LeBlanc W/R, Quinn E, etc... What's the point of using Death Sentence if you don't want to engage? See, abilities have different uses. They are not just fit for 1 situation.

&gt;Zed now has a window for enemies to have the chance to actually outplay him.

Why do you think Zed vs Ahri was considered a skill matchup? Enemies already had that chance. The ult change simply takes away from his ability to outplay people, not the other way around.

You're arguing about a patch that has yet to see live play

I should have used better wording when talking about it being an ability that sends you to a target. The point of the death mark, is to engage onto an enemy and mark them for death. To all in them. Zed is a melee assassin. He has a single ranged ability, and a gap close with W and ult. The reasoning for the change is to force him to stay in melee range for a second. 

Is this the end all be all change for Zed? No. Not by a long shot. Zed has seen a ton of changes over his lifetime. Their intention for the change is to make his ult an all in tool, what it is meant to be, and not a mobility tool, which is what you are talking about. Depending on how this goes on the live severs I'm sure we will either see the change reverted, or a change to some other part of his kit if this ends up greatly hurting him. 

Once again, you're arguing the fairness of a change that has no tangible evidence whether or not that it is unfair.  "

That said, comparing Zed ult to Thresh lantern doesn't really make sense. Given that the two abilities aren't even in the same vein of purpose and don't have any similarities beyond displacement of a champion, comparing the two doesn't make sense. I understand what you're trying to get at here, but you're trying to compare apples to oranges.

I'd say this is more comparable to something like the new delay on Veigar stun, or if Thresh's Box took longer to come up."

Too bad this meta doesn't allow for splitpushing to work. Zed was already a terrible teamfighter, nerfing his ability to teamfight is just going to destroy him as a champion. Not to mention this nerf also takes away from his splitpush ability considering it makes it a lot harder to duel and dive.

Zed is meant to be a poor team fighter. Most assassins are. Take Rengar, he's not really meant to team fight but to take advantage of vision and pick off targets. Zed excels in blowing up an isolated target, and I'm not sure if this nerf will diminish his ability to do so. 

As an avid Vel'koz player, him being there for an extra second is probably still gonna end with me dying if he plays it right and I'm without Zhonya's.

&gt;It's exactly how Zed was meant to teamfight.

I don't think that Zed is meant to dive into the fray of a 5v5 team fight and just start going at it. Again, as an assassin, he excels at blowing up a target. ""Nerfing his ability to team fight"" has negligible effects on Zed, because he is still going to be a strong assassin. If I'm not mistaken, Zed is labelled as an ""assassin"" in the game.

&gt;It's more than possible to predict how something will turn out without looking at live gameplay.

Predictions are fine. I'm only saying that we don't know how this is going to end for him. We can make every prediction we want, but if Zed comes out fine in the end, that's that. Riot likes Zed, and they'll put him where he needs to be.

EDIT: Assassins are rebalanced and changed often. Since release, Zed has received 10 changes, 5 of which have been since S4. Leblanc has seen about the same once you subtract early bugfixes. On the contrary, Yorick and Irelia have each been rebalanced once since S1. It's safe to say that if Zed ends up with the short end of the stick he'll be seeing more changes to help remedy that."

&gt;I don't think that Zed is meant to dive into the fray of a 5v5 team fight and just start going at it. Again, as an assassin, he excels at blowing up a target.

He's not. He's meant to dive into a 5v5 and then hop right back onto his shadow instantly trying to bait out all the spells and summoners he can. 

&gt; ""Nerfing his ability to team fight"" has negligible effects on Zed, because he is still going to be a strong assassin. 

It won't have negligible effects. His ability to assassinate and play around team fights is going to be extremely hindered. 

&gt;If I'm not mistaken, Zed is labelled as an ""assassin"" in the game.

No shit he's an assassin. Are you trying to say that assassins shouldn't be able to teamfight? Imagine a world where leblanc had to wait a second before distorting back. It's an idiotic change. 

&gt;Predictions are fine. I'm only saying that we don't know how this is going to end for him. We can make every prediction we want, but if Zed comes out fine in the end, that's that. Riot likes Zed, and they'll put him where he needs to be.

Riot have shown that they're incompetent time and time again. Just look at the recent history with champs like alistar, yasuo, elise, ahri etc. RIOT have no clue what they're doing half the time. 

Zed wasn't even fine prior to these nerfs and where riot thinks x champion needs to be usually isn't where x champion should be. 

This change is idiotic and only an idiot/person who hates zed would argue otherwise. "

It's almost like he has itemization paths to get around that. QSS is a magical item, isn't it?

&gt;Not really because now he won't be able to dodge your knockup when he lands...

He still has the raw damage + the death mark. Other champions aren't impervious to CC during ults (save for particular cases such as Olaf), so why should he be?

&gt; This change is idiotic and only an idiot/person who hates zed would argue otherwise.

I don't have any hard feelings towards Zed, he's actually quite manageable if you play it correctly. The people who think this change is idiotic probably don't play Zed at his fullest capabilities, not everyone can be Faker and co., after all. People are upset that you can't just pick Zed into 80% of the mages in the mid lane and curbstomp them at 6. 

Many mages aren't going to be able to take advantage of that one second and outplay him. If you're going to all-in a mage as Zed, odds are you're looking for the champion to blow their CC cooldown offensively or to miss it altogether. If the Zed player isn't smart enough to ult *after* I blow my 12 second cooldown on Vel'koz E, they don't need to be playing Zed. The chance for Zed to still make plays is absolutely still there.

Not every champion can fit perfectly into the meta. Riot does just fine at balancing champions, people get upset when they put a champion they play in a spot that doesn't exactly fit in the meta. Tanks dominate the meta. A champion like Zed may not quite fit into a meta like that."

and people keep saying 'teleporting out of screen far back just by pressing R' which is untrue, because to do that zed needs to get into ult range and save w for chasing, which is extremely risky and surely avoidable by any decent player

It's similar to Sejuani pre-rework.  Her win-rate was over 50% yet everyone considered her pretty bad.  Why is that?  Could it have been that the people that enjoyed playing Sejuani (even if it wasn't a lot of people) were largely *really* good at her?"

By the logic of ""low pick percentage, only champion mains play it, bringing up the winrate"", these champions should have ridiculously high winrates, right? In reality, they have some of the lowest winrates in the game.

It isn't as if being an unpopular pick, or having many people main your champion is a free pass to a high winrate. Ironically, in fact, Ashe mains bring down the average winrate of Ashe. A new Ashe player statistically wins more games than a Vayne main. Now tell me, is that an indication of a champion being easy, or a champion being strong? If you can pick up a new ""easy"" champion and perform better than a dedicated main of a different champion, why ever pick a different champion? Winrate is very much an indication of relative strength. In Ashe's case, maybe that means Riot wanted these Ashe nerfs because she has the highest winrate."

That's not what I'm suggesting.  I'm saying having a low popularity *could* influence winrate because people on average *could* be better.

The overall point is that winrate isn't black and white because there are a ton of factors that influence it, and because of that I don't find it to always be a great indicator of champion balance.

I'd say it's a decent proxy at best?"

Your video clip perfectly displayed how maokai is a strong champion. You could fix this by lowering the damage reduction on his ultimate, increasing cooldowns on skills, or reducing base damages or scalings. However, none of maokai's skills are inherently bad for the game.

While he is strong so there is less counterplay, the first thing I could think of would be to pick a lane bully, don't let the enemy get a laneswap to mask his weak early game, and gank him early while he isn't tanky and has little reliable escapes."

Now if Zed ults, and cho'gath does not time the blink and does not use his abilites properly, he is to blame for zed managing to blink back and kill him. 

&gt;Get QSS, Hourglass and CC"" is such a shitty excuse at this point.

No it is not. Zed is already a poor teamfighter, and those 2 items completely nullifly him, to the point of almost oblivion. Making it easier to cc him is lowering the skill needed to play against him.

&gt;Deal with the nerfs just like Yasuo and many other mains did. Adapt.

Don't remember those nerfs to specify them. This change makes it so that Zed will only ult when the other champion has used all their cc. Which they won't because they are playing against zed. plus they still have a failsafe item that block zed efectively, so even if they do waste cc before zed uses ult, they can still block him. 

All in all. Tower dives are over. Teamfight is even worse(or like katarina, which is precisely the opposite purpose of zed). Winning 1vs1/2 by dodging with shadows and avoiding cc that way is even harder. This change guts him by changing his core principles. Nerfing his damage or base stats would be better than this."

So basically you are happy about a nerf to a champion because it reduced the skill needed to counter said champion, which is already countered by cc , 2 items, and smart play.

I like that you brought up LB. To be fair she is much easier to play against than zed is. She doesnt have mana free waveclear. You can still hit her even if she uses W. You cant hit zed while he ults.  She cant splitpush.

Leblanc uses w-q-r-e-w in less than a second. Burst you 70%. after 15 sec, she does it again until she gets a kill or you have to back because of the huge burst. How do people counter leblanc: the same way they counter zed. CC. The thing is Leblanc also has huge aoe burst with w-r, which zed does not have.

&gt;he doesnt have mana free waveclear.

Blue buff, which leblanc always gets + mana regen item. and this problem is fixed.

&gt;ou can still hit her even if she uses W. You cant hit zed while he ults.

Yes you can, you can cc him right as he appear. exactly .75 seconds after disappearing you can cc him and kill him. Leblanc can be cc during dash. But there is a reason zed blink is an ult, and leblanc dash is a normal ability(w)/empowered ability(r)

&gt;As you can see Zed is good in too much things at once which is not healthy.

Zed has burst. If he tries to poke he loses escape. His teamfighting is bad, and which this change he must avoid a fight even harder.

&gt;I'm not even surprised by the nerfs to him. I wish there were more of them.

I wouldn't mind zed nerfs if it was to his damage or base stats. If this state and this meta, zed is not an optimal pick. Nerfing a core trait of him is a wrong way to balance him."

Everybody has the ability to counterplay/outplay a Zed. This can be done by simply buying the right item (Zhonya's/Qss), or by keeping track of his shadows really well. It isnt like pre-rework Nidalee that could just throw spears until 1 hit you for half of your hp, or Pre-nerf Leblanc with her silence (nightmares)"

cr8atai,t1_cr8aifg,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431558512.0,2,0,It nerfs the player's choice on Zed a lot. It messes up a lot of matchups such as Orianna and Ahri where you'd instant R out of the shockwave/charm. It fucks up his tower diving a lot if you R under a tower and don't have W or flash to escape if you had a W shadow sitting in lane already after doing a slow or fast combo to harass to get them low enough for a kill. Flashing would still warrant a tower shot since usually when you ult someone under a mid tower they walk very far back into the tower which will only make tower diving even riskier now that you can't instant R back. This is just the tip of the iceberg my friend.

I've just played a custom game to see the scaling. Crit chance increases her crit dmg by that exact amount. If you have IE that amount is multiplied by 1.5. So with a typical build you reach around 55-60 crit chance, plus IE that would be 82.5-90. In that case Ashe deals about the same damage when other champions (without IE) crit, only with every single shot once the target is slowed (which works from AA, Volley and ult).

Ashe is all about getting consistent dmg out, it has always been the case for her but now even more so. 

PS: An ADC with 60% crit chance and IE does an average of 150% base dmg (with 100 hits), while Ashe, with the same stats does 199% on average (with the first hit doing 100% and the rest 200%). This obviously means, like I said, Ashe has much better consistent dmg (with pure AA). There is no lucky crit."

It is going to completely destroy support Ashe, which I know almost no one plays, but I've been having so much fun with it recently. The crit passive and w made her so strong as a poke support early on, and the biggest downside to her was a terrible buildpath, even for a support. I know that this change will probably help adc Ashe come back a little bit, but she wasn't a weak adc, she was just different from what a normal comp needs in competitive games. She was even doing really well in the tank meta, grabbing the highest win rate in soloqueue for adcs. The change just seems unnecessary to me."

cr8rchw,t1_cr8qnch,35v7ee,leagueoflegends,1431600436.0,1,0,"Slow was basically always on before anyway, w is up a bit more but a lot of the poke came from the crit and w, and the w can't hit through minions or people anymore. With the 16s cd you could always shoot the w off and hit both laners if they were trying to cs/pressure the lane, but now they can hide behind minions, so the window of oppertunity that you have to shoot a w will be a lot shorter. The q change will help her all in but it probably wont help her poke damage much. It will change her playstyle I think for the weaker but no one can really be sure without testing it first. It should be fun to try to figure her out again, but the crit was huge for her as a support and I'm not sure if the q change can even come close to making up for that."

I've seen too many games where a Zed gets ahead and he gets cocky, dives into 5 people and gets blown up.  Now, on this current patch you watch Sejuani do the same thing and she often can't be killed before she takes out half your team.

The bonus hp means that Cinderhulk will always be the most efficient enchant for any champion that builds multiple tank items (which is almost every meta jungler, even old warrior-enchant users like Lee Sin, etc.).

At most the nerf to its combat effectiveness will mean we will see people sit on a machete upgrade, buy a brutalizer/hexdrinker/phage for early damage, then upgrade to Cinderhulk once they want to start getting tanky.

The risk vs. reward for Warrior as opposed to Cinderhulk makes it very unappealing since you have to snowball really hard for the warrior pickup to be worth it imo.

I honestly think the best way to increase diversity and balance Cinderhulk is to remove the bonus hp scaling and (buff the item's passive/base stats if necessary to help tanks).

Tanks have always shined lategame, so it's not like they need the extra help at that point. It was the earlygame that was the problem, as most tanks got pushed around due to their lack of damage resulting in weaker ganks/dueling and a slower clear. Nerfs to warrior/warrior users helped with that, as did the addition of Cinderhulk, so I think tanks would still be in a decent spot even if the 25% bonus hp was removed."

For Morgana - I think you'll now need to auto attack a caster once early on, and will require W maxing instead of just three points. More importantly, how does this impact support morgana? Starting W is a lot less satisfying with a huge 33% damage nerf at level 1 .... hey Riot, how about a +33% damage to champions buff? &lt;3

I'm 100% against making this game mechanically easier as its skill cap in that regard is already pretty low. This really turns me off, and I really hope it gets reversed. IF you misclick you should be PUNISHED for it. Simple as that. And attack move was hardly punishing as it is.Ccan't click on your target with 100% accuracy? Well there's a potential auto going on a different target. Not the end of the world but it's your fault for misclicking. What's next? Targetable abilities will now hit the closest target to your cursor? I'm so against this it's not even funny. This could negate the dropping a ward in the bush behind you while being chased by an enemy, because they could be attack moving in which you could outplay them a bit.

Now that Tiger&gt;Turtle&gt;Bear Udyr is getting pretty popular though... We may have a problem, especially since this new Black Cleaver is literally his dream item as well. Warrior, Black Cleaver, Botrk, Frozen Heart, and Banshee's is going to be a god-tier build path on him if you're doing well early.

Now they have it, it's hard to argue that they SHOULD have done  a better job. All that mattered was getting players, because once you have players you don't need a good game.

I mean most of us probably never even tried Dawngate or HotS or whatever, not because they're not better (might be, dunno) but because we've already invested lots of time into LoL. Being first made them biggest, and being biggest keeps them biggest. Being good doesn't matter."

Also you're a bit wrong on you don't need a good game but I'm probably nitpicking. They have a great game. League fucking rocks. I play it every day.

cqs4lwm,t1_cqs3dqm,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430270047.0,1,0,hmm that's true the AD isnt very high. But wouldn't talon want the 20% CDR for faster ult cooldown and thus high roaming&amp;kill potential?
cqs56pl,t1_cqs4lwm,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430271031.0,2,0,"Talons ult is basically always up anyways. The key to roaming is also movement speed. Also I'd you build this item during the laning phase then you aren't itemizing effectively.

In lane your goals are brutalizer, boots and Hydra. This gives you the power you need to burst down targets early on.  Then you get usually a Last Whisper. By this point you are in the mid game and your ult is basically going to be up and if you are fighting without your ult then you need to stop and communicate with your team.

Point is the CDR is a trap. This item doesn't have enough tangible power (AD) for him to kill people with.  It also doesn't assist in actually killing squishies."

The HP isn't stellar because of her ad-scaling shield. The CDR is usually overboard because most of the time you are rushing bruta/ionian for the quick 40% anyway.

Lots of utility, MORE kiting, AOE armour shred, and her W goes down to like 2 seconds with CDR. Obviously nothing will beat IE PD but that build is 100% glass cannon which can be risky too."
cqsb81e,t1_cqs6yoa,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430282097.0,1,0,"Yes, but where do you buy BC on Sivir?  IE PD is glass cannon.  ADC ARE glass cannon.  There just isn't room for it.  You need crit to deal the damage and kill things (IE/Shyv), meanwhile you need LW to let you deal with tanky champions unconditionally (whereas BC has to charge up the stacks to not even have as much armor pen, though it does help any other AD champ).  But your job as an ADC is to output as much damage as you can as safely as you can.  Sivir gets a tremendous amount of MS from her ult and her spellshield can offer a lot of safety other ADCs do not have.  Her passive gives a lot of MS as well already, so she's fine in the MS department.  What Sivir lacks though is AA range, that is what makes her risky.  Being able to run faster with BC and shredding armor isn't going to matter when you have to move into all these tanks ranges to AA them.  And when you are getting chain CC'd if you chose BC as your 5th or 6th item.. Well you're gonna be wishing you got a QSS"

Black Cleaver is more specialized for physical-damage bruisers. You'll see it more on Jarvans and Urgots than on Jinxes and Talons.

Doing the math, and numbers from memory so they will be wrong, I think that's 800 HP, 40% CDR, 120something armor (plus reduced damage from basics from Ninja Tabi), 50+ MR, flat and percentage armor pen and seventy or so additional AD, plus all the passives and actives.

Then from there getting BC. This is NOTHING but a buff for Wukong and seeing it any differently is silly. He's due for some slight changes to his oppressive style and I think this might push the balance team over the edge and give some adjustments to his R and E. 

Right now Wukong promotes zero-brain playstyle on a champion that shouldn't. You W, E into the fight off of W, then R for an unmeasurable amount of AoE damage that no other champion in the game can compete with off of one ability, then just win. He's like the AD version of Katarina if she was better and CC was irrelevant. That shows too. He's easily been in the top 15-10 champions for awhile now at all rankings.

If you can use the CDR, the health, have AD scalings and like Armor Pen, then it's perfect for you. The reason why for these three the health is so good is because they get resistances from their passive/active skills.

Renekton comes after that because he would scale better with resistances instead of all the health (because of flat HP ultimate and sustain on Q). Renekton's problem has always been the late game though and that tanks outscale him hard (especially if they can just build armor - that makes him pretty weak).

I'm even thinking about trying out BC + BOTRK on Renekton so I can chunk tanks. Not sure if he's too squishy though with only 3 defensive items. Time will tell!"

cqsbasb,t1_cqs6sh0,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430282264.0,2,0,"Agreed.  Yasuo in lane is melee with a fancy, yet unreliable gap closer.  Champions like Zed or Talon have direct ways of getting onto their targets, while Yasuo is reliant on a knockup, or being able to dash through minions (which is very telegraphed).  He also has 1 ranged ability.. Which requires casting an ability two other times.  The shield is what allows him to trade.  I think this is a step in the right direction at least.

Edit: This is ALSO Riot being cautious.  Yasuo is still a champion with good level 2 all in potential and if played well even level 1 he can do some mean things.  The +40 on his shield strength is basically an auto attack from an APC, which matters a TON in early trading.  At it's best this can let you do even more efficient trades.  At it's worst it takes more time to recharge your shield.

Now something else to note..  Lets take a look at Ahri's abilities.. http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ahri

Her Q 80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 (+ 70% AP).. Now assuming somewhere around 40 AP level 1.  Her Q at level 1 deals 108 damage without counting any resistances.  Counting resistances that is somewhere around 92 damage if my math is correct.  Before Yasuo would take 32 damage.  Now he can take a full Q and have a small pool left over.  Base damage wise, Ahri gains 50 damage each time she levels Q (base) and that is reliant on hitting 2 parts of the spell.  Compared to before, Yasuo's shield basically takes off 1 level of base damage.  That can be really big in trading."

If you don't really need a defensive item (QSS/Mercurial), then you can get Cleaver as your last item, which gives you 30% armor pen on top of your last whisper, it applies on Runaans, and you're almost always going to get 5 autos off before you cast your E, so it will benefit from the full armor pen. It's good against really tanky teams, and if your support is good enough, you can just rely on Mikaels, or even take cleanse if there's no spells that specifically require QSS (i.e. Suppression or Zed/Morde/Vlad Ult)."
cqrz5mm,t1_cqryke9,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430260552.0,20,0,"Doesn't sound good imo. Keep in mind BC only gives 40 AD. Adding BC on top of LW is just stacking way too much armor pen, especially since LW ignores 35% of the target's armor already. At that point, it would be stronger to just stack items that give you more AD. Don't wanna overkill the armor pen. Against really tanky teams it would probably be better to skip BT since BorK now gives lifesteal that counters HP and will give you bonus damage the more HP your enemies are stacking, and just add the LW to it.

If you really don't need a defensive item (which I highly am against unless your team is super behind). Then just build BT last item, damage and survivability to make up for lost defenses."
cqrzfza,t1_cqrz5mm,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430261045.0,10,0,"No, the 10% lifesteal still will not be enough to counter thornmail, even with it applying to the passive. Remember that lifesteal is reduced by armor too, because it applies AFTER the damage is dealt. Thus, cleaver will cause you do deal more damage and therefore also lifesteal more.

It's a huge difference in damage. 38.9% vs 57.23% armor pen (with full stacks of cleaver) will increase your damage by a ton. Yes, there are better items for her, and it might be better on someone like Zed/Talon, but the item has potential, especially against health stacking tanks. Like what else would you get for your 5th item? even an 80 AD item (All of which cost more than cleaver) won't give as much damage as a fully completed Cleaver against high armor targets, even after Last Whisper. The difference is 40 ad for +18% armor pen. I'm pretty sure you can tell which item is better late game."
cqrzwpf,t1_cqrzfza,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430261833.0,0,0,"Wait, I thought the 10% lifesteal was flat and you got bonus lifesteal from the extra BorK passive damage? Well...wtf :|

As far as damage goes, isn't the cleave a unique passive? So if someone else on your team already builds a black cleaver (which I feel like is very likely) then you won't get the passive applied anyways. Of course that requires coordination between you and your team to focus the proper targets, but regardless, if it does work out, then you won't even apply your portion of the BC armor pen. At that point, I feel like the only thing you get from the BC is the 40 AD and the extra HP, which isn't worth considering the 80 AD items out there.

If this is the case then I think BC on ADCs would be very situational depending on if your team already has black cleavers or not."
cqs0avv,t1_cqrzwpf,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430262522.0,2,0,"&gt; Wait, I thought the 10% lifesteal was flat and you got bonus lifesteal from the extra BorK passive damage? Well...wtf :|

Right now it's you get 10% lifesteal to all the damage you deal with autos but *not* including BotRK Passive damage.

After the patch, it will be 10% lifesteal to all the damage you deal, *including* BotRK passive damage, but remember that all lifesteal is mitigated by armor, so you will never out-lifesteal thornmail with only botrk, because thornmail returns 30% pre-mitigation (which is then mitigated by your own MR).

&gt; As far as damage goes, isn't the cleave a unique passive? So if someone else on your team already builds a black cleaver (which I feel like is very likely) then you won't get the passive applied anyways. 

The passive isn't unique currently, but on the new item it will be unique. This is to discourage people from stacking them on a single champion like they did back in Preseason 3. However, the armor shred stacks up to 6 times on all physical damage (both spells and autos). This means that your team can also help you apply stacks if you both build it, until you hit the cap of 6, at which point it just refreshes the duration. This means that even if you have 57% armor pen on a target with cleaver lw, your teammates will still get the 30% armor pen without having to build any item, so it benefits all physical damage that your team deals to the champion you're hitting.

TL;DR it works for the entire team, but it stacks up to 6 times (5% per stack up to 30% cap), so having more cleavers (on different champions) will stack it faster. Building the item on multiple champions also allows you to apply cleaver armor reduction to multiple champions simultaneously.

Side note: Urgot is even scarier... he reduces armor by 44% before pen even comes into play by just landing his E. This gives him a total of 65.784% armor pen with Cleaver+LW. Stacking armor to tank Urgot is an impossible task."

You don't have to rush IE just because everyone else does, it just makes it harder for you to kill tanks if they're fed. I mean, sure if you snowball lane with IE, get a bunch of kills, and then you're going to rely on your team for peel then go ahead and build IE first, but if you're against 2-3 tanks and you know it could be an issue killing them, it doesn't matter which ADC you have, just get BotRK first. You don't have to decide on your item until first back either (which could be like 7-8 minutes in if you lane decently), so you can choose at that point based on how all yours and the enemy's lanes are doing, and whether or not you still consider them to be a problem."

Do they have an AD bruiser or ADC that can viably build BC? If not pick a tank, be unkillable and laugh your way to their nexus? If yes pick something else.

I guess it is kinda already like that though, on 5.7 picking a tank into a full AD team that doesn't have Wukong is a free win, but picking it into double AP can be suicidal."

Even with both items you still can't out lifesteal thornmail unless you're hitting multiple targets with runaans all the time. The buffs in this patch to BotRK will help Kalista out by giving her even more lifesteal, but I still think cleaver could be a situationally good item on her. You could even build like BotRK Runaans LW Cleaver and you would kill tanks faster. BT lifesteal is nice but you still will deal more damage with Cleaver."

But let me ask you a question.. Why is Kalista bad against tanks?"
cqs7c34,t1_cqs5p8r,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430274676.0,1,0,"Because Frozen Heart slows your attack speed and makes you jump a lot slower. You tickle them for damage with BotrK BT and even with LW they can have upwards of 300 armor, so you're autoing thornmail for a long while before you do any meaningful damage. Just play Kalista against malphite with Frozen Heart."
cqsazfg,t1_cqs7c34,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430281558.0,2,0,"Wrong answer (well, right, but wrong).  Kalista is bad against tanks because she doesn't build crit.  Crits is what lets ADC's chew through tanks late game.  Now, as for BC vs BT...

BT gives her much more survivability vs Everyone and more damage vs squishier targets.  I would say vs tanks it may not even be that worth it to go BC over BT simply because of the trade off vs.. Duels with other carries, damage and survivability (the shield + an immense amount of lifesteal), damage to objectives (BT wins this one).  One of Kalistas strong points is being able to secure objectives by simply avoiding a smite fight.

BT vs BC.. That 40 AD is 24 damage for the first rend stack, and 12 damage per additional rend stack.

It basically comes down to Kalista by design is not a tank killer.  Kalista has an immense amount of utility in her kit, kinda like Sivir.  Kalista is the most powerful ADC for Objective Control and is good in prolonged engages.  She pushes hard and fast with Hurricane and is generally a self sufficient ADC with her ability to kite.  You can't just play her like you would other ADCs.  She's good at finding and creating picks with a strong support to throw into a team, provides vision and can easily secure objectives which let you choke out the enemy team."
cqsc5ow,t1_cqsazfg,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430284242.0,1,0,"Crit makes you kill tanks faster, but it also makes you kill yourself faster; thornmail reflects 30% of the damage back before resists, including crits. Stacking lifesteal against thornmail doesn't matter; if the enemy has enough armor you will still kill yourself to it (unless you use abilities or lifesteal off another target).

I wasn't trying to suggest Cleaver as a replacement to BT or anything, I'm just saying it's a better item against tanks than BT is. The lifesteal simply doesn't matter enough to counter the thornmail. Maybe after the BotRK lifesteal changes go through (which btw are a significant buff to BotRK carries like Vayne Twitch Kalista Kog) BT will be a good pickup to negate thornmail, but the armor pen from cleaver and gold efficiency of the item make it worthwhile to at least try out.

Somewhat off topic, but I'm of the opinion that everyone is complaining that ADC suck against tanks because they're building IE PD/Shiv first when tanks can just rush Cinderhulk Thornmail Warmogs and finish that around the same time. A much better build to deal with tanks is BotRK LW, then you can get Cleaver if you need more pen, Youmuu's to help kill squishies, or IE to start your crit build. The fact that a singular build path is not enough to deal with tanks and squishies at the same time is too difficult to comprehend. I've seen the ""ADC have no build diversity"" circlejerk several times, but I don't see why everyone HAS to build ADC first just because the meta says so. If there's a problem then try to adapt to solve it. If all attempts don't work, then it's probably overpowered and will get nerfed, but complaining without trying is just selfish."
cqs3bny,t1_cqryke9,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430267858.0,1,0,I was thinking the same thing. With bork. bc and lw you should do meaningful damage to tanks again in the late game.

cqrvglw,t1_cqruhp7,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430254584.0,6,0,"Why say it might be? Do the math

Let's say you're hitting a tank with 4k hp from 4k to killing them. 

On average, BOTRK passive will do 160 (more when close to 4k, less when close to 0). 

That 160 is then reduced by armor. 

Let's say 250 armor. 250 armor is then reduced to 152 with LW and mastery pts. Your 160 average botrk passive damage is now reduced to 64. That's 6.4 health back more per hit.

So while it's nice buff to have, against a thornmail you still need either double lifesteal, red pot or MR and lifesteal. I think the biggest problem with botrk was that it sometimes didn't even feel like you had lifesteal at some points compared to BT and the difference between them seemed like way more than 10%.

He actually gains 15 AD.

10 Flat arpen is nothing. Literally nothing. You already got all the flat you need from Warrior. That flat Arpen does nothing against tanks and you already have no issues killing squishies. A stacked Cleaver shred is also more armor pen on pretty much every champion than 10 flat is after laning phase.

&gt;extra 200 health

Finishing Black cleaver gives you 400 health total than just sticking with Brut. Which is massive when you're a melee assassin who's entire kit is designed around weaving in and out of fights, which means you'll also take a lot of damage from AoE and autos. Also most Jungle Kha builds include an armor/mr item nowadays and will go well with those resitances.

&gt;he doesn't need help sticking to people

On the contrary, a big reason why he's so out of meta right now is he simply can't stick to kite based ADC's such as Kalista without his ultimate or chain resets, especially in the tank meta. There's a reason why the most notable Kha'zix mains priortise Phage and Trinity Force.

&gt;The stacking was never good on him.

W gives him massive AoE armor shredding and he and max stacks in ~2 seconds with Q cooldown, autos, and E. It was always good on him and was considered core for a long ass time.

A Kha'zix isn't going to kill a carry in this meta in one Q/E/W/Auto rotation moron. Especially in a peel based meta filled with exhaust and BT/BoRk/Zhonyas. Even isolated in your typical build, you'll cap out at around 70% of a carry's HP. That isn't considering lifesteal, heal, exhaust,  or if they build defensive towards you(and if they do build an armor item Black Cleaver now is not just better it blows it completely out of the fucking water). Against someone tankier, you'll have to use enough Q/Auto rotations that your cleaver will be stacked long before that target is dead. If the carry has peel of some sort or is unsolated Kha'zix has even more issues.


The higher AD and CDR also lets you be more aggressive while letting you destroy a frontline. Black Cleaver gets far more damage than flat pentration through and through on both squishies and tanks while giving you quicker skill rotations. What rank are you? I can believe I'm having an argument this asinine from anyone of a notable skill level.

It will always take two Q rotations to fully kill a carry(IF they're isolated). Cleaver lets you do that faster. Like there is no fucking arugment here. Cleaver is better than Brutalizer. Through and Through."

Yes we were. The entire argument was 10 flat armor pen/Brutalizer being better than Cleaver. That's why I even responded to the original poster.

There are certainly other items Kha'zix should prioritize beforehand.

&gt;A kz will kill in one rotation

Maybe if you're two items up and the carry is unisolated with no Summoners. Otherwise no, and at that point it doesn't matter what you build does it? I prefer to look at realistic situations. Not situations based on your opponents being brainless.

&gt;KZ does not itemize specifically versus tanks

Yeah I forgot Last Whisper wasn't a core item. My bad.

People like you are the reason why his winrate is so low. And again. Cleaver is great now for a variety of reasons."
cqsp6va,t1_cqslcwj,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430320780.0,1,0,"No. You were talking about 15 AD vs. 10 arpen. Which seems to be ghostblade vs. Bc,  but then the numbers still don't add up

And the more ahead you are,  the more useless is the bc passive,  since you don't need it and can't stack it. It is bad even as a win more item. 

LW gets more bang out of your buck for the flat pen item. That is why assassins get lw despite not jumping on tanks at all. BC passive doesn't synergize nearly as well as flat pen does with LW due to how the math works.

Bottomline is KZ doesn't proc bc fast enough to justify it nor it burst fast enough to need the additional flat pen. Your money is better spent elsewhere.  How about some defense so you make sure you will survive to get another q off?

Kha'zix in general was/is also previously one of the best black cleaver users in the game, and still is to this day.

Phage passive in general is one of the greatest passives Kha can get(which is why a lot of high elo Kha'zix mains do build trinity) as it helps his chasing and weaving significantly, while CDR is massive for his Q and W.

If someone is in the middle of their minion wave (assuming 0 AP and 600 mana at lvl 1), it looks like it does 50 + 12 + 6\*(25+6) = 248 damage at level 1 (or 2), which can't be right.

Even with just four bounces (three melee minions + Ryze himself), it does 186.

Maybe it's balanced by the fact that you just don't stand in a minion wave vs Ryze.  And the damage isn't *that* out of line (level 1 Q used to do about 100 damage, and was both more spammable and less contingent than this E).

I'm not saying he needs major buffs because he really doesn't.  Most notably I'd like his R to compete with W for evolution.  Reduction of cool down between charges would be nice, for one.

You also have to be itemizing correctly against the enemy team, which often doesn't happen.

Also, of course WITNESSING is a good argument. The matches I play, the win and loss, are all part of the data that sites such as op.gg, lolking, etc use to show you the %win rate of any champion. 

Now lets say that I'm playing against a Katarina for 10 matches. If the game was only being playable by 10 people, Katarina would have 20% win ratio. So against me, Katarinas are weak. Against you, Katarinas win because YOU don't know how to play against them.

Its incredibly easy to stomp an unskilled yasuo player, you just bait their shield + 'nados, and then out trade them. He has a kit that can do plenty of things, but there is an incredible degree of skill in knowing when/why/where to use these things.

A good yasuo will use his kit ""to fuck over every way to stop him"". That's making use of good design. However most yasuos will just be 0-100ed by the ahri that out-sustained, traded, and all-inned during the massive wind wall cooldown. That's unskilled use of good design. 

He's extremely squishy. Has very poor sustain. Weak laning phase. Predictable + dodgeable skill shot. One defensive skill with an enormous cooldown. If he lands his tornado, he's very strong. If he plays his windwall smart, he will shit on your poke + exchange. 

This is 100% skill matchup and the reason why you're wrong. Practice against yasuo's more (or even better... play as him) and you'll see that as far as mid laners go, he's quite weak."
cqss0ad,t1_cqsph2o,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430325063.0,1,0,"He's poorly designed. His kit is overloaded. I'm just gonna rant about this. 

If played well, he fucks over everyone else. You cannot stop the fucker. There's always one more way he can circumvent your shit. And if you fuck up even once, he can capitalize and snowball out of control. 

He has ridiculous sustained damage. His steroid (passive) is always on. So no matter when you're fighting him, he does more damage than you. Unless you're Master Yi and have all CD's popped. This means that he cleans up fights incredibly well. If you used your tools, Yasuo wins. By default. Nothing you can do, it's just, you lose. Tough shit. Yasuo right clicks harder than you. 

Yasuo has ridiculous burst damage. No wait, that's his sustained damage. He does that all the time. Fuck you for thinking there's a time he does less damage than any other time.

Windwall is one of the strongest abilities in the game. It can be used in tons of different ways. Want to zone an ADC from a fight, windwall. Want to stop a midlaner's combo, windwall. That shit will win you games, because it utterly nullifies whole players. Sorry Draven, you don't get to impact this fight. Yasuo windwalled and you can't auto attack. Yasuo looked in your direction and pressed W. Sorry Brand, you don't get to use your abilities this fight, Yasuo looked in your direction and pressed W. 

His E isn't just a normal gapcloser, no it's a 'special' gapcloser. It doesn't work like normal gapclosers that put you in front of the person. It puts you behind them, which fucks up your rotation unless you account for it. Tough shit if you can't, you just missed a skillshot and Yasuo wins the fight.  And guess what, if you fight Yasuo in a minion wave, he can use it as much as he wants.  

He has amazing waveclear and farming ability. Because he's resourceless he can clear waves as fast as he wants, as much as he wants. You cannot shave the wave versus this fucker. He also farms incredibly well under the turret, fucking pop your windwall and go to town. It's easy as shit. 

He's resourceless. I don't know why. He just is. Fuck you for thinking there's a limit to any of this. 

He has CC. This right here is the #1 thing that breaks this champion. He's a melee carry with hard CC. No other melee carry has this. And it's broken. It's on an incredibly short CD (how many times can you cast your Q in a fight?). It last a second. It's a knockup, so you can't use merc treads to reduce the time. It's unbalanced.  

His ult is stupid, it just is. The teamfight power on this fucking this is stupid. It extends the duration of any other knockup by a whole second. You get a good Wukong ult of some shit and Yas will insure it fucking works great. It will win you teamfights alone. BUT THAT's NOT ALL. USE YOUR ULT NOW AND GET IMMEDIATE 50% ARMOR PEN. Why the fuck? What the fuck? How the fuck? I don't get why he needs this.  If you try to build armor against Yas, tough shit. He cuts through 50% of that. You  cannot build against this champ. He melts tanks. Not to mention that this incredibly strong ult is on a 20 second CD lategame. Twenty seconds. You can use it multiple times in a fight. FUCK THAT NOISE.

Now, most assassins and melee carries are vulnerable to poke. They have some sustain tools to help them out, but those cost mana (You know, that thing Yasuo doesn't have) and time. Yasuo has a solution for that as well. A shield that blocks damage. Is restored by fucking walking around, and costs him nothing. If you try to break the shield with an auto attack, it puts Yasuo in engage range, cuz you fuck you for trying to use counterplay. If you break it with an ability, you fucked up because the shield absorbs that shit. Yasuo backs off for a few seconds and gets it back again. And Yasuo has sustain because his Q applies on hit. Alloweing him to proc that shit from a fairly safe distance. And guess what most Yasuo's start? Doran's blade, that 3% lifesteal certainly is effective ain't it?

He's poorly designed.

An assassin with motherfucking CC. What kind of meth was Riot on when the designed this piece of shit."

Now that ADCs can lifesteal with the Botrk on-hit, they're going to get to lifesteal from the extra ~300 bonus damage botrk will give the first autoattack. 

If they have a BT as well, which they should lategame vs a big tankline on most ADCs, then that means they will heal for 100HP that they wouldn't have healed for before. So in total maybe like 250HP on the first auto, and around 200HP from each auto until the tank gets about half HP, at which point he should be peeled off of you in a good teamfight.

 It gets even better if the tank is just stacking HP with very little armor and you already have a Last Whisper, in which case healing for ~400HP off the first auto and 300HP on average per auto wont be out of the question.

It's considerable, at least."

Cinderhulk isn't that oppressive they could probably give warrior the 5 damage back.

Also I really hope they don't change it for top lane. It isn't mandatory in the top lane and performs comparable to other summoner spells and builds. It has not really hurt the meta in any way but expanded it slightly.

Basically if the adc can actually kill tanks you have indirectly nerfed the item already if you stack health the adc heals more while killing you in the same number of shots.

So I would wait and see how things play out. If they nerf anything regarding tank junglers I hope it is changing gromp so it no longer damages champions. "

They both do the same kind of job, but while Sion is completely skill-shot dependent (his q, e and r), it's quite complex to play him right. And the fact that he is quite counterable (high mobility characters and stuns/knock ups just make him cry.)

I don't think he deserves a nerf, but I am quite partial on that, as I play a lot with Sion, not against him."

He has almost no chance in a lane against Riven. Late game, when (and if) he gets his items, he get tanky enough to stop someone like Riven, though. Vlad is problematic though. Or Lulu, or anything with a good range poke or sustain.


He is strong, yes. I do believe he can be toned down, but the change they are doing is going to hurt him A LOT, even more so the Jungle Sion, as he will probably not be able to activate W and explode in the jungle early levels.

Late game, he will not lose any shield, but the +1 second reactivation sucks a LOT. First because that's 1 more second to the cooldown (the cd starts to count when you reactivate the shield or it explodes).

He is a champion that has a lot of downsides, like hitting Q on mobile champions (which is a big part of the meta), and being slow as hell. He NEEDS to be tanky. Does he hit too hard? Then nerf the damage of his Q late game, I don't know. They are hitting his tankiness, which is what makes him work out now imo...

If they hit his tankiness, why would you choose him, and not Maokai then?"

Enemy is taking drag, jinx ults, hits someone who has half there HP left. Ult does 25 damage to drag and the enemy laughs at you for trying to snipe with a bean bag. Enemies are going to need to be like 200hp or less for this to kill anyone. "

Let's say you ult someone with half life before this change goes in, you do 125 base dmg PLUS (and this is just a random number, so let's not get all upity at me for stats and stuff), 300 dmg from %missing health. 

Now let's say you ult that same someone, from the same spot. You now do 25 damage PLUS 300. I'm not sure where the fact that they took away 100 guaranteed damage is not getting to you, but that is the difference between kills, objectives secures and the like. It is a nerf to her overall ult damage. 

Unless you guys are trying to tell me that the ult is still going to do 125 PLUS % missing health after the 1 second flight duration.

* Maximum Physical Damage 250 / 350 / 450 +100% bonus AD + 25% / 30% / 35% of missing health

They've only changed the flat and the bonus AD components of the minimum damage, so presumably a cross-map ult will reach the max of the flat damage + bonus AD, since it scales with distance traveled? So you'd still hit 250 + 100% bonus AD + whatever the missing health part does?

And early game wise, losing a 100 shield vs a 60 shield is still only 1 aa or ability. It may scale a bit earlier and faster, but your level 1-6 strength is literally gone because of low up time on your flow. You have to remember, that the entire 100 disappears after one second after the hit. So theoretically you could have a 1000000000 shield early game and a 70 shield early game and they would have around the same effectiveness. But, you've payed for that with a 22% decrease in uptime. This might have buried his early game even more. I hate backhanded ""buffs"" "

And if he gets buffed much he makes a ton of other champs unviable without banning him, sooo.... I'm glad they didn't just hand him an extra 40 on the shield."
cqrxjnf,t1_cqrwjkp,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430257843.0,3,0,I think that was exactly their thought. Yasuo is a dangerous champion to up as he can make so many champions irrelevant when he is strong.

Yeah, for example against LB, Ez, Galio and ... eeeh... yeah I think that's all favorable matchup Yasuo has.

I think he is or was close to being a good champ in this meta. Am looking forward to the changes as I want to know if it makes him more or less powerful now. I hope the former is true as he cannot bear another nerf..."

First I don't think he will be that great since his laning phase is pretty bad now, he HEAVILY relied on consistent q poke to do much in lane. Also I don't see why the q and w damage was lowered(q mana ratio down by 4.5% at level 1!!) when q is already becoming a skill shot and w wasn't much of a huge damage threat til late. I do like the e changes but I don't see his new passive being good enough to really merit the fact that his main damage is no longer guaranteed damage. I predict people will still go tear&gt;roa&gt;archangels&gt;FH/Righteous but I think e max will take over q max and you will just try to clear waves while trying not to die early game. Late game you will be better with the new kit but I don't think your gonna get there that much. Also the cdr moving from the q to the r doesn't matter too much since FH is too good to not build so the 30% doesn't matter, all I see it doing is moving your power spike to level 11 

tl;dr q heavily nerfed, w kinda nerfed, passive not good enough, e max a thing"

People that were bitching and moaning for BT probably don't play ARAM all that much.

People discount the effectiveness of sanguine blade but it offered more early game possibilities. Farming for a BT will take much longer to make you effective. You'll complete it at around 7-8 minutes in or so. Sanguine could be completed in half that time. It also let you start with a pickaxe which is no longer a possibility if you want to go BT first item. The pickaxe start was great because if you were getting kills and CS you could forego sanguine entirely and get an IE straight up. This is no longer viable.

Towers doing more damage is going to make juggling aggro that much more important when diving early.

I'm saddened to see that they still have not bothered adding AP tenacity into Howling Abyss. This problem is going to only be compounded by the re-introduction of warmogs and the new mark/dash. Bruisers are going to shit on AP even more so than they already do in here.

I mean, the 900 range on Q and reduced mana cost is going to be sweet for farming in the lane early on in the game, but the whole point of Ryze is that in the late game he can be a powerhouse in damage while building tanky.

But a big part of that was his spells scaling off % max mana (allowing him to itemize tanky and still get damage)... which they heavily nerfed on every spell. They butchered his W completely. His Q is now not nearly as reliable. They moved the passive CDR to his ult instead of his Q... so he'll have to wait until levels 6, 11, and 16 to get the CDR which he badly needs. 

This is a champ who needed some love, not nerfs... I hope they are just very conservative numbers that they plan on raising over time to get him in the right spot. Because right now it seems like he isn't feasible anywhere but top and even then... why pick Ryze over something like Maokai? You'll get way more overall power from Maokai than this weakened Ryze."

They've made a champion who was already tanky more tanky, but they've sacrificed his damage to do it.

Ryze is going to have to build more offensive items now and rely less on tanky items that gave CDR, mana, and tank stats. That is *not* a good thing for Ryze players.

He's going to be worse off late game by a lot because his itemization is now less versatile and his numbers look worse than before.  I'd be happy to be proved wrong if this ends up unfolding a different way and he ends up better off, because I like Ryze."

"
cqrwmw8,t1_cqrvmqf,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430256386.0,1,0,"But that's the whole issue... now what does he build for an armor item? His AP scaling isn't great and FH wastes 10% CDR with his rank 3 ult.

So basically, he won't get damage from his armor item anymore, if even he builds one. He'd end up building Zhonyas I guess... which is super fucking expensive and his AP ratios aren't even that good...

So he's worse off in my opinion item-wise for armor.

Okay, what about MR? Well, he probably runs Spirit Visage here and gets his 40% CDR from that. Seems like it remains a core item for him and his only CDR item. 

The problem I have is that he's still a 600 range mage with no escape who will no longer be able to buy an armor item (if he wants to have any damage). He's going to get wrecked by ADC in teamfights.

What I need to see is the shield. That'll be the decider of if this is a buff or nerf. If the uptime of that shield is good, then it is a buff. I don't know how quickly he'll be able to get 5 stacks up in a fight. I worry he'll be basically dead to AD before he can get 5 spells off.

cqrxe71,t1_cqrwmw8,346xnr,leagueoflegends,1430257600.0,0,0,"Was just thinking about this. Iceborn gauntlet? Perfect combination of stats for Ryze and a spammable slow, increases split push potential, extra damage to throw into spell rotations as his E/W are still short enough range that you are probably thowing AA's between spells.

And uptime is something I need to know too, namely if it has a cooldown other than the stacks. If not, should be pretty damn good - can aim to be on 4 stacks before a fight starts if possible so you have one to start with, then we're talking ryze, 5 stacks is not going to be long - R, Q, W, Q, E, Q is all it should take - bearing in mind your passive reduces cooldowns of other spells by Q's cooldown, to 0.25 sec minimum, meaning casting any spell other than Q will set Q to 0.25 secs straight away.

The TL;DR is that she has a min and max damage the further the rocket travels. They are only changing the min damage which means the rocket will deal less damage point blank, but about the same damage at jinx's max autoattack range. The other thing to keep in mind is that jinx does %missing health damage with her ult, which is still intact. "

I can imagine people were relying on E to land the rest of skillshots, but from my experience E was there only so you could stop people rushing at you, or if you landed enough poke early to burst someone down, since later on you didn't need it to burst someone. And I don't understand the argument with W=suicide. Why even bother with being near enemy, when you can hammer them at max range?

Well I just talk about my experiences right now. If I were to truly debate about efficiency of old Xerath, I'd have to take into consideration more aspects.

Ano no, WQ was not iconic. It was more like WQ(E)RRRQW. All skills were important to his unique playstyle of long range arcane artillery.

Well hope this company falls flat. Cause it's competitors have been getting a lot more right then riot has in 5 years.

Way to many empty promises, broken ones, and then the one's that were made then never to be heard of again. Yup, # game development company, who sure as fuck listens to the community. Kalista being OP, well no nerfs since her release.GG

Bard is already broken why are you buffing him even though these changes aren't a big deal

Easy farming for Mundo, it will be a lot harder to deny him

More Graves buffs

Jinx nerfs don't address her problems

Kha'Ziks won't have to recall after every camp 

QOL for Morde don't expect to see him played more though

Nunu less tanky, still provides endless peel and steroid

Pantheon was given a pretty useless change 

Sion nerfs doesn't really move him up or down in tier lists though

Twitch can attack inhibs and nexus ""his was a notorious bug that kept particularly sneaky players from taking full advantage of their ability to ambush unsuspecting base structures. Shout-outs to the community for helping sniff this one out!"" well when it's existed for as long as I can remember and has been seen competitively multiple times despite twitch never being disabled I'd say it's 1 not a bug 2 well known by Riot for a long time

Xerath Bug Fix, I hated this so much I only got 2 shots off so many times and was just wondering what happened


Yasuo, unless they make him a fighter they should do whatever they can to stop him from being played I don't feel like this change accomplishes that

Black Cleaver, the item was in a fine state not sure why you're changing it, we didn't see it because champions that build it weren't seen a lot. Not sure who is losing their job on the balance team but it looks like this was never tested

skipping over bow items

Righteous Glory...once again ROA is the better tank item but I like the Glory as a support choice more anyway


no one cares about ARAM why do you still have Sanguine Blade on Dominion and 3v3
